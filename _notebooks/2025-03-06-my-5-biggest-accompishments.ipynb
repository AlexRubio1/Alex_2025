I created two APIs for this project, focusing on usability and design. The first API generates random tasks for users, while the second allows users to assign tasks to specific days. The UI was built with extensive use of CSS, especially for the calendar design, allowing for an intuitive task management experience.\n",

    "1. **Random Task API**: Users can instantly get random tasks based on selected categories.\n",
    "2. **Task Management API**: Users can create, edit, delete, and fetch tasks that are assigned to specific days.\n",
    "3. **Calendar Interface**: The design utilizes CSS to provide a dynamic calendar layout where users can manage their tasks by day.\n",
