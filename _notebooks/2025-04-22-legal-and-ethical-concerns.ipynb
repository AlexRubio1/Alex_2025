    "# Legal and Ethical Concerns in Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this post, we discuss the **legal** and **ethical** concerns that arise when sharing and using code in computer science and software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Popcorn Hacks 1:**\n",
    "- **Legal Concern:** What is a legal concern when sharing or using code?\n",
    "- **Ethical Concern:** What is an ethical concern when sharing or using code?\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Legal Concerns**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Intellectual Property (IP)**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Refers to creations of the mind like inventions, literary works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce.\n",
    "- **Impact of Digital Age on IP:**\n",
    "  - Easier to share, copy, and distribute content.\n",
    "  - Raises concerns about unauthorized use and ownership.\n",
    "- **Copyright Protection:**\n",
    "  - Protects original works from unauthorized reproduction or distribution.\n",
    "  - Copyright is automatic but registration offers additional legal benefits.\n",
    "  - Violating copyright can lead to fines or legal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Other Forms of IP Protection**\n",
    "- **Patents:** Protect inventions, giving exclusive rights to inventors.\n",
    "- **Trademarks:** Protect brand names, logos, and slogans.\n",
    "- **Trade Secrets:** Protect confidential business info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Enforcing IP Rights**\n",
    "- Measures like licensing agreements and Digital Rights Management (DRM) help enforce IP protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Licensing a Repository**\n",
    "- **What is a Software License?**\n",
    "  - A software license defines how others can use, modify, and share your code. Without it, all rights are reserved, meaning no one can legally use your code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why is Licensing Important?**\n",
    "  - Protects your work while allowing others to use it under specific conditions.\n",
    "  - Encourages open-source collaboration.\n",
    "  - Prevents legal issues when sharing code.\n",
    "  - Without a license, you can’t collaborate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Open Source vs. Open Access**\n",
    "- **Open Source Software (OSS):** Publicly available source code for use, modification, and distribution.\n",
    "- **Open Access Code:** Online research that is freely available with few restrictions on use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages and Disadvantages**\n",
    "- **Advantages:** \n",
    "  - Open-source encourages collaboration and contribution.\n",
    "  - Open Access removes restrictions on usage and access.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - Open source can be misused for harmful purposes.\n",
    "  - Open access could expose research to unethical usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Open-Source Licenses**\n",
    "| License       | Permissions                           | Restrictions                    | Common Uses                          |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **MIT**       | Free to use, modify, and distribute   | No liability or warranty        | Web apps, libraries, frameworks     |\n",
    "| **Apache 2.0**| Similar to MIT with patent protection | No liability, include license   | Large-scale projects, APIs          |\n",
    "| **GPL**       | Free to use, but modifications must be open-source | Can’t make a private version    | Software that must stay open-source |\n",
    "| **BSD 3-Clause** | Free use, modification, sharing     | No warranty                     | Academic projects, software         |\n",
    "| **Creative Commons (CC0, CC-BY)** | Allows creators to define use     | Not for software, mainly used for documentation | Documentation, art, books           |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples of License Use**\n",
    "- **Non-profit Organization:** Uses GPL to share and force others to release projects under the same license.\n",
    "- **Indie Game Developer:** Uses MIT to freely distribute and share the project with credit to the original developer.\n",
    "- **Big Tech Company:** Uses Apache 2.0 for patent protection and open-source development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Popcorn Hacks 2:**\n",
    "You're building an open-source lyric guessing app. Which license would you choose?\n",
    "- **MIT:** For easy access.\n",
    "- **GPL:** For protection against plagiarism and theft.\n",
    "- **Apache 2.0:** For patent and legal protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Considered Breaking the Law?**\n",
    "- **Examples of License Violations:**\n",
    "  - Using code without a license.\n",
    "  - Modifying and distributing GPL code without releasing changes.\n",
    "  - Removing required license notices.\n",
    "  - Selling open-source software as your own.\n",
    "  - Using code with a Non-Commercial license for profit.\n",
    "  - Copying software without paying for a proprietary license.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ethical Concerns**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Misusing Code**\n",
    "- **Respect for Intellectual Property:** Using code without permission disrespects the creator’s rights.\n",
    "- **Violation of Developer Trust:** Open-source relies on community trust; misuse harms this ecosystem.\n",
    "- **Unfair Advantage:** Using unlicensed code gives an unfair edge over others who follow licensing rules.\n",
    "- **Lack of Attribution:** Failing to credit authors is plagiarism.\n",
    "- **Commercial Exploitation:** Profiting from someone else's work without respecting the license is unethical, even if technically legal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Supreme Court Case: Google vs. Oracle**\n",
    "- Oracle claimed Google copied APIs/software.\n",
    "- Google argued it was fair use due to licensing rules and the APIs not being subject to copyright.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Plagiarism and Stealing Code**\n",
    "- **What’s Wrong?**\n",
    "  - Removing author credit and claiming code as yours.\n",
    "  - Copying code from GitHub/Stack Overflow without credit.\n",
    "  - Selling modified open-source code without permission.\n",
    "- **What’s Right?**\n",
    "  - Forking a repo and crediting the original author.\n",
    "  - Adding a comment or README for credit.\n",
    "  - Following open-source licenses when modifying code.\n",
