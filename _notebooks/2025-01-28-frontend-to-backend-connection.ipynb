    "# Task Manager Program Blog\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 **Overview of the Task Manager Program**\n",
    "In this project, I developed a task manager program designed to help users track their tasks efficiently. The application enables users to add, update, delete, and view tasks, with features powered by both frontend and backend technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 **Purpose of the Program**\n",
    "The goal of the program is to provide an easy-to-use platform where users can manage their daily tasks. It integrates a full-stack architecture that uses a database to store task data and APIs to interact with the data dynamically. And if you have no idea what tasks to create you always have the option to use the \"random-tasks\" api which is mainly focused on the big idea 1 following crud operations and Algorthims and programming and also data anyalsis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Purpose of Your Individual Feature(s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 **Feature Overview**\n",
    "My individual feature within the program is the creation of the Task Manager API, which includes four main operations:\n",
    "- **Create**: Allows users to add tasks.\n",
    "- **Read**: Displays all tasks or individual task details.\n",
    "- **Update**: Modifies an existing task.\n",
    "- **Delete**: Removes a task from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these operations corresponds to an API endpoint and interacts directly with a database to persist and retrieve task data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. **Input/Output Requests**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 **Frontend API Request and Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 **API Request (Frontend)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with the backend, the frontend makes an HTTP request using JavaScript. For example, when a user submits a form to add a new task, a POST request is made to the `/api/tasks` endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "fetch('/api/tasks', {\n",
    "  method: 'POST',\n",
    "  headers: {\n",
    "    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  body: JSON.stringify({\n",
    "    task: \"Review the key concepts from your last CSP lesson.\"\n",
    "  })\n",
    "})\n",
    ".then(response => response.json())\n",
    ".then(data => {\n",
    "  console.log('Task added:', data);\n",
    "})\n",
    ".catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n",
    "```\n",
