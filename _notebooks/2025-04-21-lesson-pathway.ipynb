    "## Homework hack 1\n",
    "### **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we're comparing the efficiency of two sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Merge Sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bubble Sort**\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a **simple** algorithm where each element is compared with its neighbor, and if they are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process repeats until the entire list is sorted. **The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n¬≤)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the list. As a result, it becomes inefficient for larger datasets because it performs a lot of unnecessary comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Merge Sort**\n",
    "Merge Sort is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm. It divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. **The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n)**, which makes it much more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger datasets. The recursive nature of Merge Sort allows it to perform fewer comparisons by breaking the problem into smaller parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comparison of Performance**\n",
    "In the code:\n",
    "1. **We generate a random list of 100 integers** between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "2. **We time how long each algorithm takes to sort the list** using `time.time()`.\n",
    "3. After sorting, we output the time taken by each algorithm and compare them:\n",
    "   - **Bubble Sort** is slower because of its O(n¬≤) time complexity.\n",
    "   - **Merge Sort** is faster due to its O(n log n) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Merge Sort is Faster than Bubble Sort**\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** consistently outperforms **Bubble Sort** because it reduces the number of comparisons and swaps needed to sort a list. The O(n log n) time complexity means that as the size of the dataset grows, the increase in time is much slower compared to the O(n¬≤) complexity of Bubble Sort.\n",
    "- **Bubble Sort**, on the other hand, performs many unnecessary comparisons, making it **inefficient for larger lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this code, you'll see that Merge Sort is faster, especially with larger datasets, due to its more efficient algorithmic design."

    "- Linear Search checks each element one-by-one, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), meaning it takes longer as the list size grows. In contrast, Binary Search divides the list in half each time, achieving O(log n) time complexity, making it much faster for large datasets, especially when the list is sorted."
