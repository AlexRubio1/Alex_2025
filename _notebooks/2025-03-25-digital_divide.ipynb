    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and analyze the digital divide globally and locally (e.g., San Diego).\n",
    "- Connect access disparities to CSP concepts like computing innovations, ethics, and societal impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSP Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IOC-1.A** – Explain how computing innovations can reflect and amplify existing societal inequalities.\n",
    "- **IOC-1.B** – Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.\n",
    "- **IOC-2.A** – Describe the digital divide and its consequences in education, employment, healthcare, and community participation.\n",
    "- **IOC-2.B** – Identify and analyze ethical and societal concerns related to computing innovations.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key takeaway:** Students without reliable internet access fall behind in school. Addressing this gap is critical to creating equal opportunities.\n",

    "*(IOC-1.A, IOC-1.B)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic privilege:** Wealthier communities can afford better infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Geography:** Rural and border regions are often underserved.\n",
    "- **Societal factors:** Language barriers, immigration status, and political influence can affect access.\n",
    "- **Bias in technology:** Innovations are often built by and for privileged groups, unintentionally excluding others.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Improve infrastructure** in rural and low-income communities.\n",
    "2. **Subsidize devices and internet** for families and students in need.\n",

    "## What Students Can Do\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offer tutoring on basic tech skills.\n",
    "- Create simple guides for internet use and tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Identify one real-world area (education, employment, healthcare, or community) where you've seen the digital divide. How does it affect people in different socioeconomic groups?\n",
    "2. Name a computing innovation that unintentionally excludes certain users. Why does that happen?\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q1:** A rural school district upgrades its internet. What could unintentionally widen the digital divide?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "C. The district requires a mandatory device insurance fee, which students in underserved areas may still struggle to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q3:** A city creates an online public forum. What action helps prevent digital inequality?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "B. The city holds in-person tech help sessions and subsidizes internet access for underserved areas.\n",
